Usage

Obtain an API Key: Sign up for a free API key from a stock market data provider (e.g., Alpha Vantage or Yahoo Finance).
Configure the API key:
Create a .env file in the root directory.
Add your API key:API_KEY=your_api_key_here

Example
from stock_quotes import StockQuotes

# Initialize the API client
client = StockQuotes(api_key="your_api_key")

# Fetch real-time quote for a stock
quote = client.get_quote("PETR4.SA")
print(f"Stock: {quote['symbol']}, Price: {quote['price']}, Change: {quote['change']}%")
